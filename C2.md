#### Server
This is the command and control (C&C / C2) server, hosting all the payloads, sending stagers and keeping track of all the victims.

#### Agents / payloads
The generated program to take control of victims, and take actions as them.

#### Beacons
A beacon is the process of a C2 payload calling back to the listener on the C2 server.

### Obfuscating agent callbacks
To hide/obfuscate the C2 process, there are a few tools you can use:
#### Sleep timers and jitter
Usually, security analysts and firewalls can notice scripts because the timing in between packets is very precise. 
Introducing jitter will make the timing seem more random.

### Payload types
#### Stageless payload
These payloads are the full package, They don't need to download anything from the C2 server.
They are pretty big, and can often be flagged by antiviruses, but have an easier time with firewalls.
#### Staged payload
The staged payload has a smaller initial size, and will download part of, or the entire RAT (remote administration tool) from the C2 server.
Because they are smaller and have less malicious code, they get flagged by antiviruses less than Stageless payloads, but because they need to download a lot they can be caught by firewalls.
