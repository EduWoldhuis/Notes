#### Streams
Read hidden filestreams in NTFS files

##### Usage
Getting ADS works differently between `cmd.exe` and `Powershell`.
```
// Powershell
streams.exe .\file.txt                    // Show alternate data streams
// OR 
Get-Item .\file.txt -Stream *             // Show alternate data streams (builtin)
Get-Content .\file.txt:stream.abc         // Show data within stream, only works with ".\", not with "..\"

// cmd.exe
streams.exe file.txt                      // Show alternate data streams
more < file.txt:stream.abc                // Show data within stream.
