Open any strange GUI processes (shortcuts) you can find, and check the authority:
```
tasklist /V | findstr PROCESS_NAME
```

To see the command/file being run:
right-click the shortcut
Select "properties"
Under the "Shortcut" tab, Check "Target"

If the process has admin rights, try opening:
```
file://c:/windows/system32/cmd.exe
```
