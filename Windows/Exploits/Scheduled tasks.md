	#### Requirements
Code execution on the target machine (any level)

##### Enumeration
To list all scheduled tasks, use `schtasks`
If you find an interesting one, use:
```
schtasks /query /tn TASK /fo list /v
```
to get more information about the task (Folder, hostname, taskname, user)

To escalate to the account associated with the "Run as User" flag, check the location of the "Task to Run" parameter and check for writability using `icalcs`:
```
icacls TASK
```
Reference your results:
```
F - Full access
R - Read-only access
W - Write-only access
M - Modify access
N - No access
D - Delete access
RX - Read and execute access
```

##### Exploitation
If the file is writable, replace it / append a reverse shell, and you're in.
