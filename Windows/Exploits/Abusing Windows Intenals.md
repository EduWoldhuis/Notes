### Shellcode Injection
To inject and execute shellcode, these steps are required:
1. Open a target with all access rights. (Usually as the same user)
2. Allocate target process memory for the shellcode
3. Write shellcode to the allocated memory in the target process.
4. Execute the shellcode in the target process memory.

In C++, these steps can be achieved using the Windows API.
For step one, the Windows C++ API has the `OpenProcess()` function:
```cpp
processHandle = OpenProcess(
	PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, // Defines access rights
	FALSE, // Target handle will not be inhereted
	DWORD(atoi(argv[1])) // Local process supplied by command-line arguments 
);
```
