Initial login: 
J.Smith sends a request to the Domain Controller system asking for a Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT)
The Domain Controller sends a TGT back, Encrypted with the krbtgt account's password (only try cracking as a last resort, it is by default very complex).
The Domain Controller also sends a session key with the TGT, which is encrypted with the User's password. **Potential golden ticket vulnerability**

Thirdly, the user will send the Domain Controller the TGT and a request for a service on the AD network, all data is encrypted with the session key from step 2.
Fourth, the Domain Controller

##### Golden ticket
When you obtain the password of the KRBTGT account, you can create any tickets you want, meaning you can impersonate anyone on the AD on all AD services.

##### Kerberoasting
When you get the encrypted password from step 4 back, you can try brute-forcing the Service's password, to create a Silver Ticket.

##### Silver ticket
When you obtain the password of the Service account, you can impersonate any account on the AD for potential privelege escalation.
This depends on the strength of the password of the Service.
